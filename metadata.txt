about= This plugin is for Spell Checking your attribute data (and allows you to build a custom Personal Word List) - it builds a basic attribute form in a Dock window - text fields are editable and the plugin creates a custom Context Menu for spell checking. On Windows you can use pySpellChecker module. For Linux / Mac / WSL you can also use Enchant. If you are using pySpellChecker as the spelling library you can Bring Your Own Dictionary (i.e. import your own Word Frequency List, which you can create with pySpellChecker) and a custom British English dictionary is included. It is necessarily clunky because QGIS does not currently expose the python bindings to allow the native attribute forms to use this functionality. You can loop through features or use a custom identify tool to view each feature's attributes. When looping through each feature of a selected layer the canvas will Pan or Zoom to each feature.  Plugin REQUIRES: pySpellChecker and optionally Enchant libraries -  which can be loaded using pyEnchant or libenchant2 in your python installation.
